title: "The Web of Power: How Elite Networks Shaped War and China"
excerpt: " Scholars have argued that powerful individuals can influence the path of a nation’s development.	Yet, the process through which individuals affect macro-level political economy outcomes remains unclear. This study uses the deadliest civil war in modern history, the Taiping Rebellion (1850–1864), to elucidate how one individual—Zeng Guofan—employed his personal elite networks to organize an army that suppressed the rebellion, and how these networks affected the nationâs power distribution. Two findings stand out: (i) counties with more elites in Zeng’s pre-war networks experienced more soldier deaths after he took power; and (ii) post-war political power shifted significantly toward the home counties of these very elites, which created a less balanced national-level power distribution. Our findings highlight the role of elite networks that propagate individual-level influences to shape national politics and the distribution of power in a society."
