title: "River Network and Conflicts: How Riverine Dynamics Impact Conflict Intensity"
excerpt: "This paper examines the link between the geographical positions of warring factions (specifically the upstream and downstream dynamics of rivers) and the intensity of conflicts, within the context of more than 400 battles fought dozens warlords in Sichuan Province, China, from 1912 to 1935. Two findings stand out: (i) warlords along the same river are more prone to initiate conflicts; (ii) conflicts along the same river generally result in fewer casualties and shorter durations compared to those between factions on different rivers. These results indicate that shared interests shape the pattern of conflicts."
